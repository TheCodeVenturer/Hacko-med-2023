## Abstract for Hack O Med 2023

Given a prescription of acupressure treatment during a consultation session, the combination of acupressure points should get reflected on to the palm map for handing over to the patient in hard copy format. If the patient is not a new arrival and has a history archived in patient database, then the patient's history page should get reflected on the screen for further prognostic procedures.
In this way, the contesting group intends to develop machine assisted tool for making quick palm prescription maps post diagnosis that is anticipated to act as help-in-aid tool for all acupressure therapists at their clinics.
Also, as the patients’ case histories get accumulated, an expert system tool is also intended to be designed so that patient can be provided with accurate color therapy and / or master acupressure point points in case of emergencies that can be approved by acupressure experts subsequently.
